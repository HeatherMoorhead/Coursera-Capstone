# Coursera-Capstone-Project

The Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone Project is an online project I completed as part of IBM's Professional Certificate in Data Science. The project is split into 5 weeks of content and introduces the Foursquare API to access location data. 
At week 3 there is a practical exercise whereby the Foursquare API is used to obtain location data from Toronto and neighbourhoods within Toronto are explored and grouped together using K-means clustering. This can be found in the notebook "Segmenting and Clustering neighborhoods in Toronto". 
Week 4 and 5 represnt the original Capstone Project. Week 4 requires us to identify a business problem that requires the use of location data and neighborhood clustering and then select a dataset that will be used to analyze to solve the business problem identified in the scenario. The week 4 noteebok "Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 4)" contains only a description of the problem/ background and a description of the data and how it will be used to answer the problem. The week 5 notebook "Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 5)" consists of : 
-Introduction where I discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project.
-Data where I describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source.
-Methods section where I discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis, any inferential statistical testing, and what machine learnings were used and why.
-Results.
-Discussion.
-Conclusion.
