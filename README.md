## The Battle of Neighborhoods: Identifying Potential Restaurant Franchise Locations.

About the course:

The Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone Project is an online lecture/ project series I completed as part of IBM's Professional Certificate in Data Science. The project is split into 5 weeks of content and introduces the Foursquare API to access location data. At week 3 there is a practical exercise whereby the Foursquare API is used to obtain location data from Toronto and neighbourhoods within Toronto are explored and grouped together using K-means clustering. This can be found in the notebook "Segmenting and Clustering neighborhoods in Toronto". 

About the capstone project:

Week 4 and 5 contain the Capstone Project content. Week 4 requires us to plan and identify a unique business problem that requires the use of location data and neighborhood clustering. We must select a dataset that can be used to analyze and solve the business problem identified in the scenario. The week 4 notebook "Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 4)" contains only a description of the problem/ background and a description of the data and how it will be used to answer the problem. The week 5 notebook "Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 5-Code)" contains all the Python code from my analysis. The week 5 notebook "Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 5-Report)" consists of a report with the following layout: Introduction; Data description; Methods; Results; Discussion; Conclusion.

Capstone project summary:

Mr Ricci, owns one successful Italian restaurant in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He recently secured capital in order to franchise his restaurant. Due to his own preferences, Mr Ricci is only willing to consider franchise locations within Manhattan or Brookyln. I was tasked with helping Mr Ricci identify suitable locations within those boroughs for his franchise locations. I obtained a dataset that contained location data (borough, neighborhood and coordinates) for all neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Using the Foursquare API I identified the top ten most commonly visited venues within each neighborhood. Using these top ten locations, I ran k-means clustering on this data to identify neighbourhoods similar to the Upper West Side. From these locations I narrowed down locations that had "Italian Restaurant" as one of their top 3 most commonly visited locations. This analysis provided Mr Ricci with 21 potential locations in which to open his franchises.
